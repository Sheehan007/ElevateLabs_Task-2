# ElevateLabs_Task-2
This project focuses on Data Visualization and Storytelling using a sales dataset (e.g., Superstore.csv). 
The main objective is to create clear, and vivd visual reports that highlight key insights from the data. By selecting the right charts, avoiding clutter, and adding contextual explanations, the goal is to demonstrate proficiency in turning raw data into a narrative that informs decision-making.
